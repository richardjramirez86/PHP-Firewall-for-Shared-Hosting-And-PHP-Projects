## üìù How It Works

The PHP Firewall operates by analyzing incoming traffic to your server. It checks each request against a set of predefined rules. If a request matches the patterns of known harmful traffic (like bad bots or attempted scans), the firewall blocks it effectively. This proactive approach helps maintain the security of your application and sensitive data.
